Gatsby shop starter with Flotiq source
===========================

Kick off your project with this event boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

Live Demo: https://flotiqgatsbyshop1.gatsbyjs.io

This project use:
* [Flotiq](https://flotiq.com) - Headless CMS for string your data (You can create account [here](https://editor.flotiq.com/register.html))
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework
* [Flotiq source plugin](https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-source-flotiq) - connector for fetching data from Flotiq
* [Flotiq components for react](https://flotiq.github.io/flotiq-components-react) - components library designed and written to work perfectly with Flotiq Content Objects and display your data beautifully

This project works on node >=18.0.0, as require Gatsby 5.

## Quick start using Flotiq CLI

Start the project from template using [Flotiq CLI](https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-cli)

 ```bash
npm install -g flotiq-cli
flotiq start [projectName] https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-gatsby-shop-1.git [flotiqApiKey]
```
* `projectName` - Project path (if you wish to start project in the current directory - use `.`)
* `flotiqApKey` - [Read and write API key](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/#application-api-keys) to your Flotiq account

This command will:
- create project based on template using the `gatsby new` command
- install npm dependencies
- setup variables in the .env file
- import example data to you Flotiq account using the `flotiq import` command
- start development server using the `gatsby develop` command

## Configuration 

Environment variables are stored in the `.env` files.
The `.env.development` file inside the root of the directory should have the following structure:

```
GATSBY_FLOTIQ_API_KEY=YOUR FLOTIQ API KEY
SNIPCART_API_KEY=YOUR SNIPCART API KEY
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR MEASUREMENT ID
```
To add `SNIPCART API KEY` to your starter you need to log in to the website: https://snipcart.com/

After this you need to get into your account options and choose `API KEYS` line or you can just click [in the link.](   https://app.snipcart.com/dashboard/account/credentials)

To see how snipcart shop is working you need to copy `PUBLIC TEST API KEY` and paste it into your `.env` file instead `YOUR SNIPCART API KEY`.

You need to remember that this is just for test look, to get fully working snipcart shop for commercial use you need to buy it on the website.
`PUBLIC TEST API KEY` below is just an example, it won't work!

## Import data (optional)

This step is optional and is not necessary if you used flotiq-cli to start the project.

If you wish to import example data to your account, before running `gatsby develop` run:

```sh
flotiq import . [flotiqApiKey]
```

It will add four example objects to your Flotiq account.

_Note: You need to put your Read and write API key as the `flotiqApiKey` for import to work, You don't need any content types in your account._

## Developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd flotiq-gatsby-shop-1/
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

Open the `flotiq-gatsby-shop-1` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index.js`.
Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Manage your content using Flotiq editor

You can now easily manage your content using [Flotiq editor](https://editor.flotiq.com).

As Gatsby generates static pages based on content from headless CMS, you have to rebuild site after the data changes.

### Update data in development

When you update the Content Object in Flotiq you have to rerun `gatsby develop`.
When you update the Content Type Definition in Flotiq, you have to run `gatsby clean` command.

_Note: To simplify this process you can configure [Gatsby Refreshing Content](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/refreshing-content/) endpoint._

### Update data in production

When you update the data in Flotiq you have to rebuild project using `gatsby build` command.

If you use hosting services listed below you can simplify the process:
- For Gatsby Cloud use [Flotiq Gatsby plugin](https://flotiq.com/docs/panel/Plugins/Gatsby-cloud-integration/#installing-the-gatsby-plugin)
- For Netlify use [Flotiq Netlify plugin](https://flotiq.com/docs/panel/Plugins/Netlify-integration/#installing-the-netlify-plugin)

For other services you can configure [Webhook](https://flotiq.com/docs/panel/webhooks/examples/) on data change or manually rebuild site in hosting service.
